<img width=350px src="https://i.ibb.co/SKGmMyM/WEEEK-1.png" alt="AllForOne - Nuclei Template Collector">

Welcome to the "AllForOne" repository! :rocket: This repository contains a Python script that allows bug bounty hunters and security researchers to collect all Nuclei YAML templates from various public repositories, helping to streamline the process of downloading multiple templates using just a single repository.

## How it Works :gear:

The script leverages the GitHub repositories which containing Nuclei Templates. It will clones them to your local machine, and extracts the templates, organizing them for easy access.

## Result :file_folder:

Once the script completes, it will display the total count of templates in a tabular format. It will create a folder named `Templates`  in the repository's root directory. Inside this folder, you'll find subfolders for each cloned repository segregated as per publication year `CVE-20XX` and others as `Vulnerability-Templates`. Each template is stored as a separate file, enabling easy access and utilization for your bug bounty or security testing activities.
